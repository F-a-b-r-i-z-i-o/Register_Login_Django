  Backend:
built with django and sqlite3. Users are registered by post request to the defined route. Each user is assigned an id and a unique jwt that will be used to login.
The implementation can be improved by adding crud operations and other routes and operations.
This project shows only a basic implementation for both administrator and basic user user registration.

Fronted:
the front was created using jquery and bootstrap to create dynamic layouts.
