# Register_Login_Django
Example of registration and login with django rest framework.

The code shows 2 parts.

1. Part.

  Backend:
built with django and sqlite3. Users are registered by post request to the defined route. Each user is assigned an id and a unique jwt that will be used to login.
The implementation can be improved by adding crud operations and other routes and operations.
This project shows only a basic implementation for both administrator and basic user user registration.

2. Part

Fronted:
the front was created using jquery and bootstrap to create dynamic layouts.
css is also used in the implementation to make the user experience more user-friendly.

This project can represent the base from which to start to implement a more complex web service to work on.

Python 3.8.5 
Django 3.2.6

Enjoy.
